# face-and-eye-recogniton

After learning Open Cv in python I decided to make a projrct to improve my knowledge in open cv and python.

The face recognition for now is somewhat perfect with a scale factor of 1.05.

But the eye detection is thbe problem to get it to work well it's best to change the scalefactor of the eye and the face to 1.3.

Maybe it's just a mistake since I did this project at night. 

But anyways

Check out the code, correct it and let me know.
